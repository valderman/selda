--   Be careful not to use this function with functions capturing rows or columns

--   lead to disaster:
--
-- > query $ do
-- >   x <- #age `from` select person
-- >   inner $ sink (\p -> x + (p ! #age)) <$> select person
--
--   Really, if you have to use this function, ONLY do so in the global scope.

-- | A unary operation. Note that the provided function name is spliced
--   directly into the resulting SQL query. Thus, this function should ONLY

--   This means that SQL operator precedence is disregarded, as all

--   @foo a b c@ will compile down to @(a ~> b) ~> c@.
